# These packages are built in CentOS 9 Stream, but the c9s composes do not have

# TODO: request that the RHEL program put these packages into c9s CRB.


packages:
  # Ceph requires -devel sub-packages from the following source packages in
  # CentOS 9 Stream:
  - cryptsetup
  - fmt
  - gdbm
  - oath-toolkit
  - lua

  # In order to build the above packages, we also require the following
  # build-time dependencies:
  #   Note, argon2 is not tagged anywhere. How are they building cryptsetup??
  #   TODO: Look up koji history for
  #   https://kojihub.stream.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=4052
  #- argon2
  #- lua-rpm-macros
  #
  # To build oath-toolkit (for liboath-devel), we require libtool-ltdl-devel.
  # This is in RHEL's "ResilientStorage" add-on, but that is not enabled in
  # mock-core-configs. Options for moving forward:
  # - Request that RHEL moves this package from ResilientStorage to CRB
  # - Make EPEL 9 depend on ResilientStorage (probably not, if it's expensive)
  # - Make Ceph require ResilientStorage in order to build (in install-deps.sh)
  # - Continue in this Copr forever (guh)
  #- libtool
